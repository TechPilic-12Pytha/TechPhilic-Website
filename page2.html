            <p>The name of the website, "TechPhilic," came from the term "hydrophilic," which refers to molecules that are absorbed or dissolved in water in general biology. "Tech" is a short term for "technology," and it is a word that is present in the strand of the developers, "STEM," with the letters S for science, T for technology, E for engineering, and M for mathematics. It also came from one of the subjects that we developers study, which is "empowerment technologies," which teaches us how to create a website.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, "Philic," which includes the letter "Phil," is a short term for "Philosophy," a love of wisdom subject where we first created and expanded our advocacy. Love is also present in our website name, "TechnoPhilic," which means "technology-loving" to us developers because it was created by developers who study technology-related courses and students who enjoy using technology every day.</p>
            <p>As STEM students and technology users, we created this website to provide information on the importance of mental health throughout life, from childhood to adulthood. By making use of technology, we can promote awareness about mental health. Just like how much we love using technology, let’s also love our mental health.</p>
            <p>We chose our advocacy mental health awareness for us to help the people who are suffering from mental health illness. Many people with mental illness may face stigma — they may be viewed in a negative way, treated differently, and made to feel ashamed or worthless as if they are somehow less than other people. Stigma can also lead to discrimination, and this in turn can make mental illness worse.</p>
            <p>Serious issues with emotion, behavior, and physical health can result from untreated mental illness and people may just think that it is not true. Anxiety and a diminished quality of life are among the complications that are occasionally associated with mental illness.</p>
